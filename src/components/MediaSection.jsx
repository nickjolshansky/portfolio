        <h3>Media Production Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My media journey began with a B.A. in Media Production &amp; New Technology from Northern Michigan University. I've directed and produced live and
          pre-recorded newscasts at WLUC TV6, operated cameras, graphics, and audio for live sports and news, and managed master control operations for on-air
          broadcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work spans video editing, 3D animation and modeling, and product photography for organizations like Goodwill. I'm skilled in Adobe
        Photoshop, Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Audacity, Open Broadcaster and Ross Overdrive.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical & Creative Media Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Hands-on experience in A/V installation, troubleshooting, and live event setup. As an A/V Technician for Conference Technologies, I supported the
        multimedia needs of a wide range of clients. I've also coordinated and set up live entertainment, including concerts and community events for
        Northern Michigan University and Traverse Area Community Media.
